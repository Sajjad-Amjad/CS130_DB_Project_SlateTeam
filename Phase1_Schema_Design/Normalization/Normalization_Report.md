# Slate Database - Normalization Report

## Executive Summary
The Slate database achieves Third Normal Form (3NF) compliance with strategic denormalization for performance optimization. Key violations are intentional and properly maintained through triggers.

---

## 1. First Normal Form (1NF) Analysis

**Requirements**: Atomic values, no repeating groups, unique rows.

### Status: ALL TABLES COMPLIANT

**Key Tables:**
```sql
users: user_id → all attributes (atomic values)
seller_profiles: seller_id → all attributes (JSON stored as VARCHAR)
gigs: gig_id → all attributes (atomic values)
orders: order_id → all attributes (atomic values)
```

**JSON Fields**: Stored as VARCHAR strings, treated as atomic values by SQL Server.

---

## 2. Second Normal Form (2NF) Analysis

**Requirements**: Must be in 1NF + no partial dependencies.

### Status: ALL TABLES COMPLIANT

**Junction Tables (Critical Analysis):**
```sql
seller_skills: Uses surrogate key (seller_skill_id) → No partial dependencies
gig_tags: Uses surrogate key (gig_tag_id) → No partial dependencies
favorites: Uses surrogate key (favorite_id) → No partial dependencies
```

**Single Primary Key Tables**: Automatically comply with 2NF.

---

## 3. Third Normal Form (3NF) Analysis

**Requirements**: Must be in 2NF + no transitive dependencies.

### FULLY COMPLIANT TABLES
```sql
users, categories, skills, tags, gig_packages, gig_images, 
order_deliveries, order_revisions, messages, offers, payments, 
notifications, seller_skills, gig_tags, favorites
```

### PARTIAL COMPLIANCE (Strategic Denormalization)

#### SellerProfiles Table
**Violations:**
- `rating_average` → calculated from reviews
- `total_earnings` → calculated from payments  
- `completion_rate` → calculated from orders
- `response_time` → calculated from messages

**Justification**: Dashboard performance for frequent queries
**Maintenance**: Triggers update automatically

#### Gigs Table  
**Violations:**
- `total_orders` → COUNT from orders table
- `total_reviews` → COUNT from reviews table
- `ranking_score` → complex calculation
- `conversion_rate` → calculated metric

**Justification**: Search and ranking performance
**Maintenance**: Triggers recalculate on changes

#### Orders Table
**Violations:**
- `price`, `delivery_time`, `revision_count` → copied from gig_packages

**Justification**: Historical data preservation (packages may change after order)
**Maintenance**: Set at order creation time

#### Reviews Table
**Violations:**
- `overall_rating` → (communication_rating + service_rating + recommendation_rating) / 3

**Justification**: Frequently queried field
**Maintenance**: Trigger calculates automatically

## 4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) Analysis

### BCNF COMPLIANT TABLES
```sql
categories: category_id → all attributes, name → category_id (both candidate keys)
skills: skill_id → all attributes, name → skill_id (both candidate keys)  
tags: tag_id → all attributes, name → tag_id (both candidate keys)
users, messages, offers, payments, notifications
```

### BCNF VIOLATIONS
Same tables as 3NF violations - determinants exist that aren't candidate keys.

## 5. Intentional Denormalization Summary

| Table | Denormalized Fields | Reason | Maintenance |
|-------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| seller_profiles | rating_average, total_earnings, completion_rate, response_time | Dashboard performance | Triggers |
| gigs | total_orders, total_reviews, ranking_score, conversion_rate | Search/ranking speed | Triggers |
| orders | price, delivery_time, revision_count | Historical accuracy | Order creation |
| reviews | overall_rating | Display performance | Triggers |

---

## 6. Trigger Maintenance System

**Key Triggers:**
```sql
trg_calculate_overall_rating: Updates overall_rating in reviews
trg_update_seller_rating: Updates rating_average in seller_profiles  
trg_update_gig_ranking: Updates gig metrics when orders complete
trg_order_completion: Updates total_orders in gigs
```
